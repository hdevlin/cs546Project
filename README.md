# CS546 Project: Quizzo
A simple learning platform.

## Usage
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run seed` to seed the database with sample data
- Run `npm start` to start the server

To begin taking lessons on our platform, simply login or sign up using the link on the Dashboard. That will navigate to a login/signup form. A list of all available lessons is viewable on the Lessons page, but only logged in users can access a particular lesson. Signed up users also have access to their Profile page, which shows all of their lessons in progress, completed lessons, and earned badges.
